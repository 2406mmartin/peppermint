# Welcome to Peppermint üçµ

We are an Open Source Ticket Management System hoping to improve the user experience for people in teams
or using similar software on their own. Our aim is to create software which is easy to use but still offers all the
feature rich components paid solutions have.

Using docker-compose we can quickly get a copy of the production build,
the following docker-compose below can be used to get the up to date production build of Peppermint.
